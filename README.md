# BDC_Subsystem

This is my Subsystem, that is used in nearly every UMG, AI and HUD System of my Projects.
it will expand from time to time, get more optimized and is granted new Features.

The System depends on CommonUI, EnhancedInput and CommonInput.

So make sure to activate those Plugins (if not natively activated or integrated in newer UE5+ Versions) and Setup CommonUI correctly (added the Viewport to your Project Settings and set the Default Confirm and Cancel Options).

The Plugin comes with some of my UI Elements like Button Text, Slider..etc, a UI Focus handler and Interfaces for UMG and HUD Communication.
It also exposes some C++ CommonUI Elements, like the Video Player, to Blueprint.


The Plugin comes with a small, yet unfinished demonstration.
